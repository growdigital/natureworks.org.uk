A #WoodMeadow is a *model* not a *blueprint* for #sustainable, biodiverse land management. The idea is an accessible, low-impact, multi-generational space that provides sustainable livelihoods, delivered with #DirectDemocracy & #Recommoning. Think #landscape #ForestGarden.

This is Ty Canol #WoodPasture in #SirGar #Pembrokeshire, similar structure with mosaic of trees & fields (admittedly quite a lot of Bracken too).

It‚Äôs a #NatureEmergency. What‚Äôs required is a mosaic of habitat & low-impact food production, not industrial monocultures driven by profit. Our current food system is broken and food needs decommodifying.

A #WoodMeadow is one approach to #resilient & #sustainable land management that provides a wealth of #biodiversity.

This is Ty Canol #WoodPasture in #SirGar #Pembrokeshire. Just look at the diversity of #lichen, #moss, #trees & #habitat
