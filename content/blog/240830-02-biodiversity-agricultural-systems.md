### Silva Vilumets, chair
## 1. From agricultural land to rewilding areas
### Maria Medina Vidal
- Mar Menor, Natura 2000 site, 12kha catchment area
- Intense agriculture, mine tailing, 480m euro budget, multi-agency
- "Green Belt" 
	1. semi-natural wetlands (reduce N, P, SS), 
	2. "Green Filters" 8,251mÂ² per day - pump, woodchop bioreactor, plants filter, constructed wetland
	3. Rewilding areas - 200ha purchase. Not popular. Alternative, temporpary water ponds. 
- Landscape restoration - "edible forest" using traditional local species - date palm, fig, pomegranate, carob, almond, olive
## 2. Current  policies fall short of effective pollinator conservation in agricultural landscapes
### Gabriella Bishop, pHD candidate
- Need for habitat conservation targets 30x30
- Biodiversity Strategy 203 set 10% agricultural goal - scientific basis? 
- How much habitat?
- Pollinator conservation in agricultural areas
- Habitat quantity & quality improve pollinators
- Habitat quantity & quality framework, help explain relationship - see photo
- Increase quantity of habitat up to point, then increase quality

## 3. Restoration ecosystem services at field margins
### Jaan Liira, University Tartu
- Margins main alternative for patch habitats. Project 2011-22
- Reasonable limit 2-3m
- Huge turnover field margins
- Sampling in strip away from road verge
- *useful for verges project*
- "we had positive changes but not much"
- target abundant species, as functional diversity

## 4. Disturbance induces similar shifts in arbuscular mycorrhizal fungal communities from grassland & arable field soils
### Siqiao Liu, University Tartu

## 5. Impact of abandoned lands on natural pest control in arable lands
### Silva Vilumets
- "Passive rewildling". Dangers biodiversity loss, increased fire risk, food security
- *Carabidae* (ground beetles) and *Staphylinidae* (rove beetles)
- Studies show *Carabidae* can reduce pest population by 50%
- Require sustainable & diverse habitats
- EU Horizon 2020 project "Framework" - Estonia (arable), Italy (olives), Austria (grassland)

## 6. Native species for greenging agroecosystems
### Micol Orengo, University of Pavia

- Native species in agricluture
- Need for coexistence of agriculture. Cover crops.
- Aim: process of selection for native species
- Cover crops.
- *Use of perennial native cover crops?*
- 3 problems & functions
	1. Soil nutrient loss
	2. Excessive use synthetic fertilizers
	3. Superficial erons
- Link plant traits with functions
- Plant Trait Database - TRY database
- Initial selection - region, form, abundance, habitat
- *Not looking at changing managment model?*
- Native species perform as well as commercial mixes

*Resilient agriculture is wildlife griculture*
*"Food is free in most universes"*
*Support local, sustainable, resilient businesses - key "industries" eg *
*Organic as requirement of RBAPS*
*Don't use chemicals or fertilisers. There we go, solved.*
*Adam yn yr Ardd - Wales only 5% self-sufficient in food. Al?*
*Different agricultural model required*
*SYSTEM CHANGE*
*Ecology in agricultural school?*
*Areas of high nutrient, field  run-off, use for high nutrient crops*
