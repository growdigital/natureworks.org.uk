Tonight was the inaugural event at the 14th European Conference on Ecological Restoration, an ice-breaker event with free wine and beer and delicious snacks. I really wasn’t knowing what to I expect but it felt like the first day at school, where people gather in groups and chat and laugh, and some people don’t.

I have to be honest, I’m not really a people person. I mean, I like people, don’t get me wrong. But I’ve been travelling for 3 days with a stinking cold and I am **tired** and I just want to talk about the climate emergency and designing resilient food systems. And then I’m somehow going to find the wherewithall to get up and approach a total stranger and say hello, glass and canape awkwardly in hand? I sat there for an hour, thinking about what is possibly one of the greatest house music tracks of all time, and then cycled back to the hostel.

It’s the full day starting tomorrow, I’m sure I’ll be back on form and it will all be worthwhile. But crikey, that was hard, awkward social working.
