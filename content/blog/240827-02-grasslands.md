### AM session
## 1. Bulgarian Society for Protection Birds
- Southern Bulgaria
- Eastern Imperial Eagle key species 
- Different grazing
	- sheep & goats x5
	- cows & horses x8
	- grazign mixed x5
	- mowing x5
- Location of site (image)
- *What* is goal?
- Shannon's Diversity Index - shrubs between 20%-60% greatest diversit
- Birds mixed grazing best, 20-25% is optimal for maintaining hib rid diversity
- Overgrowing more than 50% reduces bird diversity (but chart?)
- Mammals - grazing by mixed animals
- Mammal diversity 40-60%. No intensive grazing
- "Presence of shrubs is key for maintaining high biodiversity"
- Optimal 20% birds, 20-60% reptiles, 0-10%(?) for Souslik
- Shrub removal mandated by govt. "grasslands should have no shrub" for agricultural susbsidy. "Driven by subsidies". 

## 2. Which condidtions favour the occurrence of priority effect
### Example of restoration of mountain grassland
#### Renaud
- Objective: species-rich grasslands
- Common: simultaneous seeding
- **Priority effects** - species arrival order & date in a community affect abundances, creating historical contingency in the community structure and that may lead to altnerative states
- **May manipulating order of arrival allow multipel target species coexistence**
- Early seeding of less competitive species first?
- 1st year sowing, 2nd year sowing, 4th year monitoring
- Dominants & subordinates
- A framework for when PE may be important

## 3. All the small things: a cocnept of grassland restoration drivers & ecological processes
### Markus Bauer
- The idea of **target**
- Myth modifying site is enough
- Landscape context is crucial for local biodversity
- Historical contingency - species pool
- Alternative stable/transient states
- **Regional** species pool
- Combine ecological theory with ecological restoration
- The filtering concept, Keddy 1992 - integrates elections, dispersal & speciation
- "Chaos and stochacisity we have always"
- Myth: single endpoint exists
- What can we control and what not?
- Easy-to-control factors  - which species, which donor sites, how to seed, which traits, how to prepare & care
- Weather fluctuations, management variability or long-term management causes temporal variation. 
- Combine assembly theory and restoration ecology, find easy-to-control factors
## 4. LatviaNature habitat
- Standardise habitat condition
- Variation between member countries
- Study aims
- Select parameters & indicators, thresholds for habitat condition
## 5. What can we learn from long-term monitoring of restored grasslands regarding climate change experiment
### Anita Kirmer
- Direct seed harvesting
- But donor sites not optimal seed bank. Included drought tolerant species. 
- 4 variants & 3 repetitions
- Does climate change require change in grassland restoration
- Introducing species proved successful. 
- Seed mixtures for climate mitigation
- offenlandinfo.de/en
## 6. Importance of pristine grassland fragments supporting/restoring grasslands
- Pristine defined as 50 years+ old
- Compared taxonomic & functional doo-dahs
- Hypotheses
	- Diversity of both pristine & recovered is strongly scale-dependent
	- Pristine grasslands more diverse than recovered ones
- Functional saturation hypothesis vs functional equivalence hypothesis
- Grasslands in Hungary 
- Shannon diversity, DCA ordination
- Species richness remains much lower in restored grasslands
- Functional equivalence but huge difference, after 50 years
- No driver to increase the diversity
- Peter Grime - motivation behind rare species, increasing species  pool for future changes. High number rare species provides evolutionary stability.
- "Lunch is more importance than science"

### PM session

Peter Torok chair, Netherlands
## 1. Pioneering ecological restoration in Mediterranean coastal habitats

### Christo Georgiadis, Hellenic Soceiety for the Protection of Nature

- 2 areas Greece: Nestos River, Italy Palo Laziale
- *What happens when 4degC temp rise messes with your neat habitats? I'm sure there's a list somewhere*
- Target habitats - grasslands and river.  Temporary lakes (floodplain meadows)
- Amorpha fruticosa invasive - assessment distribution via #drone, serve as reference point
- Total 14ha, 60% covered
- A. fruticosa control - investigating grazing/cutting/shading: shading net, Alnus glutinosa, Populus alba, removal & geotextile, repeated cutting, grazing
- Fenced grazing with goats, eat everthing. Seems grazing most efficient method.
- Grazing not allowed in national park!

## 2. From collapse to recovery: unveiling biodiversity resilience after exclusion of overgrazing in Dutch ocastal sand dunes
### Daan Kinsberg, Phd cadndidate, univ Amsterdam
1. Project background
	- Overgrazing by Fallow Deer. 
	- Large grazing exclosures, up to 7ha 
	- Questions
		1. How do characteristic habitat types develop after high-intensity grazing?
		2. Do characteristic dune species return
		3. Are there **negative** effects
2. First results
	- Flora indicator - not much change
	- Flower availability - higher, but  less species
	- Vegetation height - 
	- Insect groups - butterflies a bit more, bees & wasps a bit more
3. Synthesis
	- No strong recovery patterns except for flower abundance
	- Strong year effect caused by extreme weather conditions
	- Exclosures are better than doing nothing
	- No grazing not an option

**Tapestry lawn is like timed grazing**

## 3. Incoroprating the European Green Deal
patri@isa.ulisboa.pt
- Degradation of freshwater ecosystems
- 8 principles of ecological restoration (check  SER website)
- What scientists know, what managers need, what law prescribes
- **Importance of monitoring & assessment**
- How to effectively assess & monitor (see photo of slide)
- MERLIN mainstreaming ecological restoration of freshwater related ecosystems in a landscape context 
- Also Green Deal **includes societal & cultural aspects**
- See Goals of the European Green Deal - 13 of them!!
- Portugal - Alder Wetland Forest, in Lima. Lot owners in the areas, land divided historically between sons
- Social indicators -  visitors to website, partners etc
- Lessons
	- Trade off between project reporting & task implementation
	- 

**Remote sensing for grassland restoration - cost-effective?**
**Tie in with traditional festivals**

## Grassland restoration on arable land: resilience to drought along the succession
### Yuying Jing, University Tartu

- Semi-natural grasslands - biodiversity, forage, carbon storage
- Restored grasslands must be resilient to drought
- From plant community, conservative (slow-growth)
- Hypothesis: 
	- Slow growing genotypes more tolerant to drought - yes
	- Plants  in home soils more drought tolerant - home soils grow better but not drought tolerant 
	- Old grasslands more tolerant - yes
- Briza media - characteristic slow growing species
- Restoring soil health is essential
