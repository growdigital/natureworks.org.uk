### Catrin Westphal, chair
## 2. Navigating grassland restoration
### Ioana-Alexandra Patru-Duse, 
Hungary
## 3. Peatland restoration in Scotland in the face of the biodiversity crisis
### Matilde Meertens, Ghent University
- IPBES report [The Diverse Values & Valuation of Nature](https://www.ipbes.net/news/global-assessment-summary-policymakers-final-version-now-available)
- Values
	1. Instrumental
	2. Relational
	3. Intrinsic
- Mechanisms for participation
- Relational values go much deeper
## 4. Ecosystem engineers spill-over of biodiversity
### Isabel Dedyn, Krakow university
- sustainable production & consumption, not mentioned very much
- beaver ecosystem services
- Higher bird diversity & abundance on beaver sites, with effetcs >100m
- Also benefit to shrub & forest dwellers
- Larger eaver ponds, stronger biodiversity impact
## 5. Species interaction
### Annika Hass
- Calacerous grassland conservation
- Abandonment
- InterRest project - effect of management on species interactions
- Estonia, Germany, Spain, 32 study grasslands per country
- AES - agri-environment schemes
- Challenges: profitability, trade-offs & lock-ins, policy fit & interplay, changing rural societies
## 6. Evaluating restoration success at landscape level through plant-pollinator interactions through meta-networks
### Eleana Velado-Alonso
- Interactions frequently neglected
- Should be key target!
- Usually studied at local scales
- At broader scales, meta-networks (new methodology, interactions across a space) Emer et al 2018
- Resesarch quetions! - see photo
- Interaction richness depends on surrounding landscape
## 7. Butterfly assemblages in restored grasslands
### Annika Schmidt, Grassworks project
- https://grassworksprojekt.de/en/
- 1990-2020 30% decline
- Land Use Intensity index - mowing frequency + grazing + fertilisation
- Species richness & abundance restored sites similar to positive reference sites
- Directly harvested seeds
## 8. A social-ecological systems approach to ecosystem restoration in Western Rwanda
### Vicky Temperton, Restor
- The delineation bwetween soical an natural systems is artifical an arbitary Berkes and Folke 1998
- Forest Landscape Restoration 
- Rwanda is a poster child of FLR
- Bonn Challenge https://bonnchallenge.org
- Restore Rwanda DFG Research Unit 2022-2027
- Ecological, soical-ecological, social
- Remote sensing of for clusters for 100 villages
- Subproject 1 biodiversity impacts - vegetation, bird, butterfly
- 1ha & 25mÂ²
- Subproject 2 Living Lab - compare 2 villages with similar ecology but different governance models
