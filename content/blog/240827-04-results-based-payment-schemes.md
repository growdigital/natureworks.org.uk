## 1. Results-based agri-environment schemes for support of broad biodiversity at landscape scale in Transylvanian high nature value farmland
### Cristi Gherghiceanu
- 95,000 hectares, SCI, ⅓ forest, ⅓ meadow, ⅓ village
- Rich biodiversity. Tarnava Mare 85kha, Pogany-havas 60kha
- Agri-environment payments management-based, not biodiversity analysis
- RBAPS - more freedoms, more variability
- Pros - clear link, "production" becomes part of farming system, farmers rewarded for entrepeneurial effort,
- Cons -  in some cases not possible to design indicators, managing authority doesn't always have access to RBAPS expertise, farmers must be willing
- Target: hay meadows of high nature value. Farmers required to manage land
- Need to support loical incomes and existing management
- Aim for 90ha 
- Indicator species - see photo, check time
- 30 indicator species for TM & PH 
- Simple plant identifications for fa rmers, "self monitoring"
- Payment leels
	- 5 species 213euros ha  pa
	- 8 species 229
	- 10 species 259 ha pa
- Area in pilot 175ha
- Not adopted to 

## 2. Segetal flora species monirtoing with off-the-shelf UAV-based sensors and deep learning for result-based payhment schemes in arable land
### Caterina
- Segetal flora species declining in Europe cos intensive agriculture
- High cosst of monitoring can put schemes 
- Which species can be mapped?
- Struggle with key indicator species - easily identificalble and sensitive to agric changes
- 32 genera, 105 species
- Main crop winter barley
- monitored from height 10m, 20m & 30m
- Half species detectable, both flowring & non-flowering, species of same genus difficult to differentiate. 1 hectare of land monitored in 8 minutes.

## 3. Birdwatch - a satellite supported service evaluate the impact of agri-environmental policies on farmland brids
### Natasha from Birdwatch
- Agricultural ecosystems aren't healthy
- Strong interest in effective measure. Need monitoring
- Proposition: farmland bird habitat suitability as an *objective indicator* and *decision variable* for results based payment schemes
- Data & info, monitoring, planning (mathematical model), implementation (tool for farmers to use)
- Habitat suitability maps - ie probability that a bird chooses this area as a habitat
- Germany, Lithuania and somewhere else
- Selection of 10 species
- https://birdwatch-europe.org/
- Need ornithologists! Multi-disciplinarian project


## 4. Grassland management under CAP: a case study of Latvia
### Peteris Lakovskis
- sown grassland vs permanent grassland
- importance of monitoring
- indicators - species, litter layerb

***what is state of grassland monitoring in Ceredigion?***


1.1m ha in Iereland under results-based payment scheme under CAP - Gary Goggins



## 5. From theory to practice: first findings from implementing result based pilot programme for grassland biodiveristy conservation in Latvia
### Maija Medne

- semi-natural grassland habitats <1% state area
- **Blooming Meadows**
- 65 contracts, 4 years 2023-2026, 678ha potential valuable grasslands, smallest 0.6ha, largest 30ha, meadows & pastures
- 50/50 half & hybrid
- +7 voluntary participants
- Hybrid - minimum compulsory management measures, if fulfilled
- Monitoring results - carried out by famer and expert. 
- Monitoring species & structures
- field forms: Fieldmaps/Survey123 applications
- Structures monitored: 8 items - see photo & time
- Plant species - listed 50 taxa (16 genus, 34 species). Grouped by colour of flowers
- Training & comms - compulsory annual seminars, WhatsAp group (a living organism)
- avg support 105 euro/ha
- making relationshiops among collaborators - use of whatsapp group

## 6. Result-based support pilot activity in the semi-natural grasslands subsidy scheme in Estonia
### Annaliisa Kaaremaa, Estonia Environmental Board
- 80,000 ha semi-natural gras, sland, half is being maintained, state aim to manage more
- Rules stipulating subsidy regulation, 
- PIlot 500ha coastal & flooded meadows
- Additional payment 15 euro/ha for managers
1. Methodology development - scorecards. More forms! Plant guide. Forms *tested*. 
2. Pilot sites & action plans - oversubscribed. Action plan for 5 years, reviewed every year. Example of action plan, without management 10 years, Anthriscus sylvestris & Angelica archangelica. 2nd Abruka coastal meadow
3. Training. 
4. Biodiversity monitoring 2023 & 2027
5. Evaluations - scorecards managers vs experts, whether scorecard point system appropriate, calculate best payment levels, which support system do managers prefer?
