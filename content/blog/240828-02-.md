### Vicky Temperton, Chair
- Biotic interactions & social interactions
## 1. Impact of grassland abandonment , degradation & resoration on ecosystem services & multifunctionality
### Elisabeth Prangel, University Tartu
- Ecosystem services definition
- Grasslands as biodiversity hotspots
- Grassland degradation - see graph (cf George Peterken)
- LIFE to alvars (specific semi-natural calcerous grassland type)
- Cessation of traditional management
- Spider diagram - photo
- Need more, long-term studies for monitoring
- 10 year contract for landowners. 

## 2. Best practices in butterflies and pollinators conservation in Natura 2000 sites in Slovakia
### Katarina Tuharska, Slovakia
- Restoration of meadows, 1400ha 105 localities
- 13 butterfly species. Good 'umbrella' species
- Butterfly endangered major cause degradation habitats
- Abandonment traditional land use, of land, creation of homogenous grasslands. 
- Lot of afforestration
- Action: clear-cutting shrubs & young trees, 
- Rotation and mixed grazing & mowing, fallow land for 1-2 years
- Large grassland divided into 1-3 hectare scares, native windbreaks
- Restoration of wide ecotones, margins & transition habitats
- Photo of forest pasture
- Restoration of small-scale habitats
- Planting food plants
- Complicated land ownership
- Volunteer scything
- Working with stakeholdss, 60% stakeholders, 40% 
- Question about fudning: Funding from LIFE project. Provide infrastructure at beginning. Get land back to subsidy scheme for landowners. Sometimes can't find anyone, have purchased all sorts of animals as NGO! 40% managed by NGO, 3 farms over Slovakia. Have set up a company, also get the subsidies. Cooperation with the locals always the best.
- Question: importance  of relational values. Interactions with smallholders & also bigger agricultural. Leading by example, and over time, long-term relationship & working in the area. Vicky, good lever for change "See what the neighbour is doing"

## 3. Ponderful: pond restoration as a nature-based solution to climate change through biodiversity enhgancement and alteration of greenhouse gas contributions
### Helen Greaves
- Strategic lead of Norfolk Ponds
- https://ponderful.eu - Horizon 2020 project UCL
- Ponds largely neglected from policy
- Represent 30-50% standing water worldwide
- Ponds - still water body 1mÂ² and <2ha 
- 50-90% pond losses in European countries over past century
- Many overgrown & terrestialised
- UCL Pond Restoration Group - vegetation & sediment removal
- Open ponds support double amount of macroinvertebrates
- Comparison GHG & 5 restored, overgrown, open ponds
- Maps of history of ponds
- Long-term management, every 3-5 years?
- Freshwater Habitats Trust https://freshwaterhabitats.org.uk
## 4. Endangered Species recovery
### Dennis de Ryck, Natuurpunt
- Aim, connect science & practise
- Winge Valley
- only 17% of north western european species have seedbank for more than 5 years
## 5. Flood retention capacity
### Marius Kalinauskas
- Land abandonment
## 6. Coastal life project
### Rorben Bramming Jergensen
- 40m euro funding
- Coastal salt meadows
## 7. Carbon stocks & carbon stability in submerged soils of a hydro-electric reservoir in the Icelandic highlands
### Susanne Claudia Mockel
- 80% electricity used by heavy industries
- Environmental consequences hydropower
