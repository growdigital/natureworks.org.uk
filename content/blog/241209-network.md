> using orogeny and magic together in a way that supports and strengthens each, making a stronger whole. Then integrating this into a network of orogenes working toward a single goal, all of them together stronger than they are individually, and plugged into an obelisk that amplifies their power manifold. It is amazing

As part of my day job, I‘ve helped set up [Glaswelltir Ceredigion Grassland](https://glaswelltirceredigion.cymru/). Landscape intervention together with thoughtful planning. Integrated into a network of ecology minded grassland folk working toward a single goal, plugged into a newsletter that amplifies their power manifold.

And in Stone Sky:

> We do not understand that what Kelenli has come to give us is a sense of *peoplehood*. We do not understand why we have been forbidden this self-concept before now… but we will.
> And then we will understand that *people* cannot be *possessions*. And because we are both and should not be, a new concept will take shape within us, though we have never heard the word for it because the conductors are forbidden to even mention it in our presence. *Revolution*.

Living creatures have personhood. What does that mean for our society based on attitude of exploitation?
