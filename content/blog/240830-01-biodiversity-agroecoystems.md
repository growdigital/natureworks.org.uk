Functional Agrobiodiversity & Agroecology

### Biodiversity declines in agricultural landscapes
- Land use change - consolidation, agrochemical, habitat loss
- Loss of biodiversity - species richness & ecosystem services
### Sustainable agriculture
- Figure Lundin et al 2021 Front. Ecol Environ.
- Landscape-scale implementation based on agri-environmental collaboration - ecological & socio-economic benefts
### Managing pollination & biological control
- Anders et al 2023 J Appl Ecol
- Pollination limitation in Macadamia orchards
- Nut damage decreasing with increasingsemi-natural habitats
### Spillover
- Species-rich hedgerows enhance predation rates
- Connected hedgerows promote pollination services
### Managing crops to promote ecosystem services
- Ecological benefits of legumes
### Managing agricultural landscapes
- compositional & configurational complexity & land use intensity
- -- the chap who sent through the golden ratio garden plan
- Landscape heter
### Restoring lime quarries for wild bee populations
- Approx 50% woody cover & high landscape diversity faciclitate assembly of abundant bee populations
- Management very important - grazing, mowing, shrub clearance
- Enhancing connectivity across landscape
### Designing agricultural landscapes
- Agri-environmane
- Improve co-operation NGOs, govts,  - to identify target habitats
- How can we design biodiversity-friendly and productive landscapes?
	- Kooperativ - coopoerative design & implementation. 
	- Importance of local farmers organisation
	- Implementation 258ha perennial flower fields - 42 farms, 11 study landscapes, 9 municipalities
	- Intensive biodiversity monitoring
- Agri-environmental collaboration
