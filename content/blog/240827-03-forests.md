## 5. Established invasive tree species offer opportunities for forest resiliencde to climate change
### Bart Nyssen
- Ecosystem Resilience Approach ERA -  preventing dominance of invasive alien species by *strengthening the resilience* of forest and nature
- 5 major invasive alien tree species
	1. Ashleaf Maple (Acer negundo)
	2. Tree of Heaven (Ailanthus altissima)
	3. Black Cherry (Prunus serontina)
	4. Red Oak (Quercus rubra)
	5. Black Locust (Robinia pseudocaccia)
- Traits - abundant seeed production, at young age, easy disperal, rapid juvenile growth
- But juveniles need lot of light, short live 
- Basically, pioneer traits
- ERA: enahcnce competition by increseeing tree species diversity and redundancy
- Plant late succceesional species & introduce tree species
- International cooperation 
- EITS resilience to climate change.
- Impact of EITS  on nutrient availability
- Microclimate reinforces climate change resilience of forests impoartant are:
	- closed canopy
	- presence of a sub-canopy
	- shrub layer
- Nurse tree effects are important to initiate forest regeneration & succession -- research in Tree of Heaven in Romania and in Ashleaf Maple in France, Eucalyptus in Spain
- EITS may temporarily & locally dominant
- Advocating replacement

## The forest garden as a reference ecosystem: a gardener's approach to restoration, ripe with potential
### Harris Morrison
- France, northwest of Paris
- Rolland Vasseur Middle School, near town of Vigny
- 2005-6 educational garden
- 400mÂ²
- Woodland fragment, meadow, orchard
