Quite mundane, taking photos for my portfolio. Struck by the beauty of the garden, the life in the garden.

It is about **being there**.

This is the Clifftop Garden.

# What’s the point?

**This** is the point, life is the point.

# Changes in small places

“changes in small places affect the global system, not through incrementalism, but because **every small system participates in an unbroken wholeness**…. In this exquisitely connected world, it’s never a question of ‘critical mass.’ It’s always about **critical connections**.”

_~ Grace Lee Boggs_

???

Critical connections, like the ones being made right here, right now.

Emphasis mine.

![Yellow bird on field](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_520/v1694179536/yellowhammer-bird-150316.jpg)

“changes in land use arising from a push to increase yields as much as possible so as to maximise profit margins… **capitalism is the cause of the Yellowhammer’s decline**”

_~ [Jonathan Dean](https://jmdean1982.medium.com/time-to-get-angry-beyond-the-cosy-consensus-in-british-nature-conservation-a833ee0fd7ec)_

???

Emphasis mine.

# Capitalism

Current system rewards concentration of capital

* Colonisation
* Industrialisation
* Automation at scale
* Expertise, siloed & unrestrained
* Monopolies
* Profit the only measure

???

Alternatives, please, anyone?!

# Wildlife forest garden

### “Emulating woodland edge,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;layered, with edible perennials,<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;self-sustaining nutrients & pest control”

???

In cool temperate and warmer climates. Think of it as a wildlife orchard underplanted with edible shrubs and perennial vegetables.

---

# Native plants

![Insect on leaf](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_520/v1655895713/insects/tenthredo-livida-060630.jpg)

# Garden questions

![Screenshot of Antonia Malchik No Trespassing post](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_420/v1694246434/no-trespassing-antonia-malchik-230909.png)

* Who owns the land?
* Who pays the money?
* Where does the water go?
* Provision for maintenance?

???

* Capital only projects commonplace
* Until we have Universal Basic Income, people should be paid for work! Relying on volunteers ain’t right. cf caring

# Garden action

![Hoverfly on flower](https://res.cloudinary.com/growdigital/image/upload/w_320/v1693827832/hemp-agrimony-hornet-mimic-hoverfly.jpg)

* Tree spacing ¼-½ avg canopy dia
* Gabions “units of habitat”
* Pond (water)
* Dead hedges
* Chop ‘n’ drop comfrey
* Native plants where possible
